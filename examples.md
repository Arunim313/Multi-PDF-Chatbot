# Example Queries and Responses

This document provides example queries that users can ask the application, along with the expected responses.

## Example Queries

### Query 1
**User:** What is the assignment about?

**Response:** The assignment is about developing a retrieval-augmented generation agent that can take a natural language query as input, fetch relevant documents from a vector database, and use the retrieved context to produce a more accurate, contextually informed response. The agent should be able to reason about when to retrieve documents versus relying on existing context and should be capable of chain-of-thought reasoning to break down complex queries into steps and fetch documents at the right time. The assignment also includes requirements for clear documentation, code quality, evaluation, and testing.

### Query 2
**User:** Who is Arunim ?

**Response:** Arunim Malviya is a student pursuing a Master of Technology in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the School of Data Science and Forecasting, DAVV Indore, India. He is also currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at NYX, where he has been involved in developing recommendation models, engineering ETL pipelines, conducting QA testing, and leading data migration projects.
