## Components
1. **Streamlit Application**: The user interface where users can upload PDFs and interact with the AI.
2. **PDF Processing Module**: Responsible for extracting text from uploaded PDF documents.
3. **Text Processing Module**: Handles the chunking of text into manageable pieces for embedding.
4. **Vector Store**: Stores the embeddings of the text chunks for efficient retrieval.
5. **Conversation Chain**: Manages the interaction with the AI model and retrieves relevant information based on user queries.

## Data Flow
1. **User Uploads PDFs**: Users upload one or more PDF documents through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Text Extraction**: The application extracts text from the PDFs using the PDF Processing Module.
3. **Text Chunking**: The extracted text is chunked into smaller pieces for embedding.
4. **Embedding and Storage**: The text chunks are embedded and stored in the Vector Store.
5. **User Queries**: Users can ask questions about the uploaded documents, and the application retrieves relevant information using the Conversation Chain.

## Conclusion
This architecture allows for efficient processing and retrieval of information from multiple PDF documents, providing users with a seamless chat experience.
